# Precompiled ZeroMQ libraries for FPGA project
To include those libraries in target system execute
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamusek-007/compiled/
cd compiled
rm README.md
cp -r ./ /usr/
ldconfig
```
and they are ready to use!

# Important Note!
Project was made due to science club called "Bractwo In≈ºynierii Cyfrowej" on DSW Wroclaw University, on which I've participated.
